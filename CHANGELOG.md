# [attractors v2.0.0](https://github.com/vdesmond/attractors/releases/tag/2.0.0) - January 2025

# Announcements
A complete rewrite of the attractors package. Read my quick note on the migration [here](https://attractors.vdesmond.com/#creators-note)!

## Breaking Changes
- Complete restructuring from v1.x - not backwards compatible
- Removed CLI support (may be reintroduced in future versions)
- Changed main API interface to use registry pattern instead of class-based approach
- Migrated visualization system to use dedicated plotter classes (though it is still on top of matplotlib)

## Features & Architecture
- High-performance numerical solving with Numba JIT compilation
- Registry system for systems, solvers and themes enabling easy extensibility
- Robust visualization system with static and animated plotters
- Advanced trajectory processing with downsampling and color mapping
- Support for both JIT and non-JIT execution paths
- Modern type hints throughout codebase
- Comprehensive test suite including numerical stability tests (still in progress)
- Better documentation (still in progress)
