The attractors package is built around four main components that work together to create beautiful visualizations of strange attractors:

## Systems
Strange attractor systems are defined by their differential equations. attractors comes with 20+ pre-defined systems...

## Solvers
To generate trajectories, we need to solve the differential equations numerically. The package provides several Runge-Kutta methods...

## Themes
Visual styling is handled through themes that control colors and appearance...

## Visualization
The package offers flexible options for both static plots and animations...
